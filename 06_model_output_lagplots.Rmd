```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE)
```

In this code, I will analyze model output for the selected model (bc_ozone_pm10). I will plot the random effects, and the plots of lagged effects and main effects of ozone, bc, and pm10.

# Lag-response and exposure-response effects


# Random effects plots
